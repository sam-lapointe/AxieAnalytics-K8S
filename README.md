# AxieAnalytics
AxieAnalytics is a web application that **indexes** asset **sales** in the Axie Infinity ecosystem (Web3 Gaming). While the official marketplace displays current listings, it lacks a clear history of past sales. AxieAnalytics fills this gap by **tracking**, **storing**, and **visualizing asset sales** data on the Ronin blockchain using native Azure microservices and event driven architecture.

## In progress
Currently working on migrating the application to Kubernetes.
